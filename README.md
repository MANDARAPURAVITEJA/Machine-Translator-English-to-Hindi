# Machine-Translator-English-to-Hindi

## 🪄 About
This is a Natural Language Processing(NLP) project. The project aims at building a NLP model which can convert the text from English language to Hindi language using Transformers.

The project was created using Python Flask framework.

## 🏋🏻‍♂️ Motivation
Hindi(हिन्दी) is the National language in India, and one of the official languages of the Government of India. It is an official language in nine states and three union territories and an additional official language in three other states in India. Hindi is also one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Republic of India.
So, a person travelling across the Nation need Hindi to be known. So, we build this project for translating the language from English to Hindi.
